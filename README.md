# PROJECT
<h1>ITP project 2nd year 2nd</h1>
<p>Our revolutionary online food ordering system
streamlines the process of browsing and ordering from
nearby restaurants. Featuring a user-friendly interface,
customers can effortlessly navigate menus, add items
to their carts and complete secure online payments. On
the restaurant side, the system empowers them to
manage menus, track real-time orders and easily
update item availability.
In this effort, my specific contribution lies in inventory
management. I focus on ensuring seamless
organization and tracking of restaurant inventory,
allowing for efficient updates on item availability and
supporting the overall functionality of the online food
ordering platform.</p>
